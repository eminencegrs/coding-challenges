# Climbing Stairs

We are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.  
Instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time,  
we can climb any number from a set of positive integers `X`.  

For example, if `X = {1, 3, 5}`, we can climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.  

We need to generalize a function to take in `X`.
