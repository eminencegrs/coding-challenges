# Theory

**PriorityQueue<TElement,TPriority>** represents a collection of items that have a value and a priority.  

- **It implements an array-backed, quaternary min-heap.**  
- **Each element is enqueued with an associated priority that determines the dequeue order.**
- **Elements with the lowest priority are dequeued first.**
- **The type does not guarantee *first-in-first-out* semantics for elements of equal priority.**
