# Coin Change

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations 
and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.  
Return the number, in how many ways you can make the target amount.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

## Examples

### Example 1:

Input: `coins = [1,2]`, `amount = 5`
Output: `3`
Explanation:  
`5 = 1 + 2 + 2`
`5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2`
`5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1`
