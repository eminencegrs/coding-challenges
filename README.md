# Welcome to the Coding Challenges Repository! ðŸš€

This repository is a consolidated collection of solutions to popular coding challenges. 
It serves as a resource for practicing problem-solving skills, learning various algorithms, 
and understanding common patterns in coding interviews.

## Structure

The repository is organized into multiple sections to streamline access to different types of content. 
Each section focuses on a unique platform, making it easy to explore specific challenges and solutions.

### Theory

This section contains theoretical explanations and common patterns used in algorithm design and problem-solving. 
It covers foundational concepts like the sliding window technique, dynamic programming, and recursion, 
which are frequently applied in coding challenges.

 - [Common Patterns & Approaches](./Theory/CommonPatterns&Approaches.md)
 - [Binary Trees & Traversal Types](./Theory/BinaryTrees.md)

### [DailyCodingProblem](./DailyCodingProblem/README.md)

This section includes solutions to problems from *Daily Coding Problem*, 
a platform that sends one coding challenge each day. 
They help build a daily habit of practicing coding and algorithms.

### [HackerRank](./HackerRank/README.md)

The HackerRank section contains solutions to problems hosted on *HackerRank*, 
a popular platform for coding challenges across various domains, 
such as data structures, algorithms, SQL, and more. 

### [LeetCode](./LeetCode/README.md)

This section holds solutions to *LeetCode* problems, 
one of the most widely used platforms for interview preparation. 
LeetCode challenges cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, 
making it ideal for preparing for technical interviews in software development.
